    <h1>About Random Password Generator</h1>
    <p>A random password generator is software program or hardware device that takes input from a random or pseudo-random number generator and automatically generates a password. Random passwords can be generated manually, using simple sources of randomness such as dice or coins, or they can be generated using a computer.</p>
   <h1>What makes something “random”?</h1> 
<p>If I use a random password generator 5, 10, 100, or 100 times with the same parameters, there’s little chance that the generator will create the same result twice because it’s supposed to be random–meaning the results will be unpredictable, won’t follow a set pattern, and a previous result will have no effect on any of the following outcomes. But the results I see aren’t really random, they only appear to be random.

In a BBC broadcast, Marcus du Sautoy, the Oxford Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford, says that “randomness” is non-deterministic, meaning you will not be able to work out what is going to happen based on previous information.

Sautoy uses the example of rolling dice, and claims that if you know the exact “initial setup” of the dice prior to rolling them–their dimensions, weight, the amount of force applied to the dice, the contours of the surface the dice land on, the distance and speed traveled before landing on the table, etc.–then you should be able to predict where they will land. “But the point is that we can never know the precise initial setup of dice, meaning it’s non-deterministic,” he said. We can apply this same logic to shuffling cards, the lottery, playing a roulette wheel at a casino, and other games of chance.
